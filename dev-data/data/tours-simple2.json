It is not possible to begin devotional service without a spiritual master. The Spiritual master is the via media between us and Krsna’s lotus feet. This is Krsna’s mercy.

Only the Lord’s devotee is eligible to become a spiritual master. This is not an exaggeration but a fact. Lord Krsna states, “As they surrender unto me I reward them accordingly.” In the conjugal pastimes, Krsna’s devotees serve Him with their entire body. Krsna reciprocates by giving Himself to those devotees. He considers Himself indebted to them. The ultimate perfection and goal of service is found in the conjugal mellow.</p>\n",

Temporary material propensities are not the original characteristic of the spirit soul but only the characteristic of the materially conditioned living entity. Material propensities are changeable because they are temporary, but devotional service destroys lamentation, illusion, and fear, all of which come from absorption in matter.

  "excerpt" : "<p>A libreated soul does not desire liberation. The devotees are liberated souls. Therefore, they do not desire religiosity, economic development, sense gratification, or libration. Devotional service is full of happiness. Everything else is devoid of happiness. Thus only a devotee is actually happy, whereas everyone else is distressed and disturbed. Because there is no devotion in the activities of <em>karmis</em>, <em>jyanis</em>, <em>yogis</em>, <em>bhogis</em>, and <em>tyagis</em>, all of them are restless. Materialists think, “Let me be happy and let other suffer,” whereas those walking the unalloyed devotional path think, “Let us perform <em>hari-kirtana</em> together twenty-four hours a day without cheating anyone.” The path of unalloyed devotion requires no mixes, because chanting the holy name is an infallible weapon. First one hears through the ears, then gradually one finds the other senses favorably engaged. At that point, one becomes qualified to see the form, qualities, pastimes, characteristics, and associates of the Lord. According to this consideration the devotees gradually make advancement on the path of devotional service.</p>\n",

  "date"     : "2022-05-05 00:00:00 -0400",

  "excerpt" : "<p>Those who join the Matha with a return ticket do not completely want the Supreme Lord. Does a person who actually wants to attain the Supreme Lord wish to return from there? If we awaken our propensity to serve the Supreme Lord, do we want to give up our direct service to the Lord so we can again become busy serving Maya? Those who have attained spiritual knowledge do not and cannot approach their worshipable Lord with a return ticket. Only those who are puffed up with false ego, who wish to become masters, who have dependents to look after, who adore someone other than God, and who instead of accepting themselves as the spiritual master’s servants proudly proclaim themselves husbands, fathers, learners, foolish, poor or rich. These persons suffer anxiety and distress because they are introxicated with the pride of accepting themselves as servants of their wives, sons, and daughters. That is why the scriptures advise us to approach a spiritual master. In approaching, there is no question of return. The Vedas state , <em>tad vijnanartham sa guru eva abhigacchet</em> - if we want transcendental knowledge, we must approach a bonafide spiritual master. <em>Abhugacchet</em> means “to take shelter”.</p>\n",

  "date"     : "2022-05-04 00:00:00 -0400",

  "excerpt" : "<p>We accept both the universal spiritual master and the initiating spiritual master. By accepting only the <em>jagad-guru</em>, we may face many <em>anarthas</em>. If at present we want to follow Christ’s orders by accepting him as <em>jagat-guru</em> and we think that we do not require an initiating spiritual master, we will certainly face the doubt about how well we can follow Christ’s orders. The Supreme Lord or universal <em>jagad-guru</em> delivers His instructions about the Absolute Truth only through the disciplic succession. As I sit on the back of Ganges in Navadvipa, far from the Himalayas where the Ganges originates, and am able to touch her water here, the initiating spiritual master similarily brings the Ganges of pure devotional service, which emanates from the Lord’s lotus feet, and places it in my hand and on my head. If the flow of the Ganges did not come to me, then because I am an ordinary, powerless, poor person, I would not have been able to climb the Himalayas to touch her water. Or if the flow of the Ganges from the Himalayas was intruppted on the way, I would have had to face the danger of accepting a polluted flow instead of the pure Ganga. If the instructions Jesus Christ gave two thousand years ago do not come to us through the disciplic succession, or if we have to sort them out from books, then perhaps we may create a blunder and accept a perversion of the truth taught in the name of Christianity. We may even come to accept something opposite from what he taught, thinking it his actual philosophy.</p>\n",
