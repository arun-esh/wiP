# Section 6 Express: 

Express is a framework for building web applications and APIs. It is designed to be fast, flexible, and powerful.

## Starting our API: Handling GET requests

add Setup the API v1 along with project data files

```
url: /api/v1/tours
This will help us to build and test v2 without breaking the
system for version 1.

File systsem files will be read once and must be outside the
event loop function.

It is better to send status code with each request.
API GET Request
	localhost:3000/api/v1/tours
API GET Response
	Status
	length of the array
	Data from JSON file
```
